# GREEN DAY quiz

   - This web quiz is about Godâ€™s favorite band Green day

   - This web quiz contains numbers of simple question about Green day

   - With this web quiz I didn't target a specific audience like old fans or hard core Green Day fans,
     this web quiz is for all kinds of people, so the idea was to keep it very simple, 
     the quiz contains 10 questions and they are very easy, I didn't go into their old staff,
     questions are about popular songs, so that player can go through and maybe learn something new about them, become a new fan or just have some fun.
